### 1. What is a linked list?

​                                       &uarr; a node                      &uarr; a value      &uarr; a pointer

- A linked list consists of **nodes**.
  - Each node consists of a **value **and a **pointer** to another node.
  - The starting node is referred to as the **header**. 
- Linked list is a chain of values connected with pointers.



### 2. Why use linked lists?

​	Linked list is often compared to **arrays**. Whereas an array is a fixed size of sequence, a linked list can have its elements to be dynamically allocated. 

#### Advantages

- A linked list **saves memory**. It only allocates the memory required for values to be stored. In arrays, you have to set an array size before filling it with values, which can potentially waste memory.
- Linked list nodes can **live anywhere in the memory**. Whereas an array requires a sequence of memory to be initiated, as long as the references are updated, each linked list node can be flexibly moved to a different address.

#### Disadvantages

- **Linear look up time**. $O(n)$ 



### 3. Linked Lists in Python

​	Here's how to implement a linked list in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val):
        self.val = val
        self.next = None	# pointer initiated points to nothing
```

​	With the Node class, we can implement linked list as follows:

```python
node1 = Node(12)
node2 = Node(99)
node3 = Node(37)

node1.next = node2	# 12 -> 99
node2.next = node3	# 99 -> 37
```

### 4. Traversing Values

​	Here's how to traverse through values in the linked list:

```python
class Node:
    ...
    
    def traverse(self):
        node = self
        while node != None:
            print node.val	# access the node value
            node = node.next	# move on to the next node
```

​	It starts from the head note, check its value, and move on to the next node. Once 	hits the end of the linked list, the node should not have any value (None).



### 5. Reverse a Linked List

​	input: 1&rarr; 2&rarr; 3&rarr; 4&rarr; 5&rarr; NULL

​	output: 5&rarr; 4&rarr; 3&rarr; 2&rarr; 1&rarr; NULL
