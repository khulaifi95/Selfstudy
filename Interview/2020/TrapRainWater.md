### Trapping Rain Water



#### Question:

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.



#### Example:

| <img src="TrapWater.assets/Screenshot from 2020-08-09 16-52-42.png" style="zoom: 150%;" /> |
| :----------------------------------------------------------: |
|          **Fig 1**. Elevation map of trapped water           |

The above elevation map is represented by array `[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]`. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

```pseudocode
Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
```



#### Solution:
