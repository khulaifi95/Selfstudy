## Best Timing of Buying and Selling



#### Question:

Say you have an array for which the `i-th ` element is the price of a given stock on `day i`.

If you were only permitted to complete **at most one transaction** (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

- Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.



#### Example:

```pseudocode
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```



#### Solution:

The optimal value of **lowest buy-in** for the current day is always in the range of `[0, i-1]`.

- We can orderly visit the array, updating the lowest buy-in price for every day.

- We then update the maximum profit as the difference of the price and the lowest buy-in.



#### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices):
        minprice = int(1e9)
        maxprofit = 0
        
        for price in prices:
            maxprofit = max(price - minprice, maxprofit)
            minprice = min(price, minprice)
            
        return maxprofit
```
