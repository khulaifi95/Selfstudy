## Validate Palindrome String



#### Question:

Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

- For the purpose of this problem, we define empty string as valid palindrome.
- `s` consists only of printable ASCII characters.



#### Example:

```pseudocode
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
```

```pseudocode
Input: "race a car"
Output: false
```



#### Solution:

1. The most important part is to filter all **number and letter** characters in lower case.

- In Python and C++, we have the built-in function `isalnum()` to check for it:

```python
sgood = "".join(char.lower()) for char in s if char.isalnum()
```

- The first method is to simply check the reversed list of strings:

```python
return sgood == sgood[::-1]
```



2. We can also use **two pointers** on each end of the string to check **in-place**.

- The pointers move towards each other whenever the character is not a letter or number.
- Return `False` directly when the pair of characters don't match.



#### Code:

```python
class Solution:
    def validPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        n = len(s)
        left, right = 0, n - 1
        
        while left < right:
            while left < right and not s[left].isalnum():
                left += 1
            while left < right and not s[right].isalnum():
                right -= 1
            if left < right:
                if s[left].lower() != s[right].lower():
                    return False
                left, right = left + 1, right - 1
                
		return True                
```
