## Copy List with Random Pointer



#### Question:

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index] ` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`.
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

| **Fig 1**. Data structure of the linked list with random pointers |



```pseudocode
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```



#### Solution:

We can save time by creating a `visited` tag for copies of each node.

1. **Backtracking**

We backtrack the `random` and `next` pointers respectively.

Starting from the `Head` node:

- Check if the current node is copied.
- If not, create a new node and save it in the `visited` dictionary.
- **Recursively** call two pointers.

```python
if head in self.visited:
    return self.visited[head]

node = Node(head.val, None, None)
self.visited[head] = node

node.next = self.copyRandomList(head.next)
node.random = self.copyRandomList(head.random)
```



2. **Iteration**

We traverse the linked list from `Head` and create new nodes visited by two pointers.

Iterating from the `Head` node:

- Create new node as the copy and save into the `visited` dictionary.
- Copy the next node on the `random` pointer, check for `visited`.
- Copy the `next` node, check for `visited`.



3. **Twisted iteration**

We can copy all the nodes by their side.

- Traverse the linked list and create a copy for each node by its side.
- Use old nodes' `random` pointer to update the new nodes' `random` pointer.
- Unweave the list and fix the `next` pointers to separate lists.



#### Code:

```python
class Solution:
	def copyRandomList(self, head: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        if not head:
            return head

        ptr = head
        while ptr:
            new_node = Node(ptr.val, None, None)
            new_node.next = ptr.next
            ptr.next = new_node
            ptr = new_node.next

        ptr = head
        while ptr:
            ptr.next.random = ptr.random.next if ptr.random else None
            ptr = ptr.next.next

        ptr_old_list = head
        ptr_new_list = head.next
        head_old = head.next

        while ptr_old_list:
            ptr_old_list.next = ptr_old_list.next.next
            ptr_new_list.next = ptr_new_list.next.next if ptr_new_list.next else None
            ptr_old_list = ptr_old_list.next
            ptr_new_list = ptr_new_list.next

        return head_old
        
```
