## Merge Two Sorted Arrays



#### Question:

You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.

Initially the number of elements in A and B are m and n respectively.



#### Example:

```pseudocode
Input:
A = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
B = [2,5,6],       n = 3

Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```



#### Solution:

We can observe that the two input arrays are **partailly sorted subarrays** of the merged array.

We use the `merge` method in merge sort as an analog.

- **Two pointers** on the arrays respectively, comparing the elements with each other.
- Pointers **start from the end** utilise the empty slots in $A$.



#### Code:

```python
class Solution:
	def merge(self, A, m, B, n):
        pa, pb = m-1, n-1
        tail = m + n - 1
        while pa >= 0 or pb >= 0:
            if pa == -1:
                A[tail] = B[pb]
                pb -= 1
            elif pb == -1:
                A[tail] = A[pa]
                pa -= 1
            elif A[pa] > B[pb]:
                A[tail] = A[pa]
                pa -= 1
            else:
                A[tail] = B[pb]
                pb -= 1
                
            tail -= 1
```
