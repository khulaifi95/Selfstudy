## Binary Tree Level Order Traversal



#### Question:

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).



#### Example:

Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,

```pseudocode
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Return its level order traversal as:

```pseudocode
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]	
]
```



#### Solution:
