# Computer Systems

CS107 builds up and expand your breadth and depth of programming experience and techniques. The course will work from the C programming language down to the microprocessor to de-mystify the machine. With a complete understanding of how computer systems execute programs and manipulate data, you will become a more effective programmer, especially in dealing with issues of debugging, performance, portability, and robustness. 

### Topics: 
- C programming language
- data representation
- machine-level code
- computer arithmetic
- elements of code compilation
- runtime performance
- memory organization
